Review and customize this INITIAL.md with your specific detailsn2. Run the PRP v3 workflow: ./workflows/enforce-prp-workflow.shn3. Review the generated PRP for remaining developmentn4. Continue development following PRP guidancen5. Use validation loops for all new featuresnn## Notesn- This INITIAL.md was generated based on analysis of your existing codebasen- Customize the sections above with your specific project detailsn- Focus on what still needs to be built, not what's already workingn- The PRP v3 will provide specific implementation guidance for remaining worknEOFnnecho "   ✅ INITIAL.md created based on existing project state"necho ""necho "📋 INITIAL.md Contents:"necho "   • Project context and current state"necho "   • What's already built vs. what needs work"necho "   • Integration approach for existing codebase"necho "   • Quality assurance requirements"necho "   • Implementation focus for remaining development"necho ""necho "💡 Next Steps:"necho "1.
